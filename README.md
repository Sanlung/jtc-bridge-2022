## About

Bridge seeks to connect those who have questions about entering/exiting prison with those who have the answers. It is an interactive message board where anyone can post a question and anyone can respond with information and advice based upon their own experience. The app is targeted to individuals who are soon to enter prison and also those who are soon to be/have been released, as well as to friends and family of those two groups. User questions and responses are to be divided into 3 categories: preparing to go to prison, issues affecting friends and family of incarcerated persons, and making the transition from prison to home.
